   title: Natual Language Processing of Electronic Health Records
   abstract: >
       Electronic medical records (EMRs) play an increasingly
       important role in healthcare. However, the rapidly growing
       volume of text in EMRs creates challenges for information
       extraction (IE). As such, many research institutions are
       developing computer-based systems to automate EMR structured
       IE. This paper investigates the processes, the challenges, and
       the current state of automated IE of EMRs with a specific focus
       on automated systems that extract ICD9 codes from clinical
       text. While automated system performance has caught up to the
       accuracy of manual coding under specific circumstances,
       automated code extraction remains mostly an academic
       exercise. To extract value from their work, researchers should
       shift their focus away from highly specialized algorithms that
       work in isolation and instead collaborate with industry to
       develop augmented intelligence systems that help make coding
       professionals more effective.
