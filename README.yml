   title: Natual Language Processing of Electronic Health Records
   abstract: >
       Electronic medical records (EMRs) play an increasingly
       important role in healthcare. However, the rapidly growing
       volume of text in EMRs creates challenges for information
       extraction (IE). As such, many research institutions are
       developing computer-based systems to automate EMR structured
       IE. This paper investigates the processes, the challenges, and
       the current state of automated IE of EMRs with a specific focus
       on automated systems that extract ICD9 codes from clinical
       text. While automated system performance has caught up to the
       accuracy of manual coding under specific circumstances,
       automated code extraction remains mostly an academic
       exercise. To extract value from their work, researchers should
       shift their focus away from highly specialized algorithms that
       work in isolation and instead collaborate with industry to
       develop augmented intelligence systems that help make coding
       professionals more effective.

        Like the internet in the 1980s and early 1990s, blockchain is a grossly misunderstood technology
        that has the capability of transforming a wide variety of industries. These industries extend 
        beyond just financial transactions and cryptocurrencies and includes healthcare and supply chain.
        This paper reviews the history and current status of blockchain and investigates use cases for 
        how blockchain can transform healthcare and supply chain.

        Like TCP/IP in the 1970s and 1980s, blockchain is a new, intriguing but grossly misunderstood technology 
        that is still in its infancy. It is commonly misunderstood as just a technology for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
        However, blockchain's use cases extend beyond just financial transactions and cryptocurrencies, and have the potential
        to transform nearly every industry including healthcare and supply chain. As the technology matures, additional
        transformative use cases could expand into drug distribution and specifically to opioid supply chains. Despite this potential,
        a publicly-available blockchain specifically for opioid supply chains was not found. The collective review and analysis of
        blockchain, pharmaceutical supply chains, the opioid crisis, and the demonstrated blockchain model suggest that the adoption
        of blockchain systems for prescription opioid supply chains would enable numerous capabilities that could mitigate certain 
        aspects of the opioid crisis.
