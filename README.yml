   title: Natual Language Processing of Electronic Health Records
   abstract: >
       Electronic medical records (EMRs) play an increasingly important role in healthcare. However, the rapidly growing volume of text in EMRs creates challenges for information extraction (IE). As such, many research institutions are developing computer-based systems to automate EMR structured IE. This paper investigates the processes, the challenges, and the current state of automated IE of EMRs with a specific focus on automated systems that extract ICD9 codes from clinical text. While automated system performance has caught up to the accuracy of manual coding under specific circumstances, automated code extraction remains mostly an academic exercise. To extract value from their work, researchers should shift their focus away from highly specialized algorithms that work in isolation and instead collaborate with industry to develop augmented intelligence systems that help make coding professionals more effective.
