    abstract: >
        Like TCP/IP in the 1970s and 1980s, blockchain is a new, intriguing but grossly misunderstood technology 
        that is still in its infancy. It is commonly misunderstood as just a technology for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
        However, blockchain's use cases extend beyond just financial transactions and cryptocurrencies, and have the potential
        to transform nearly every industry including healthcare and supply chain. As the technology matures, additional
        transformative use cases could expand into drug distribution and specifically to opioid supply chains. Despite this potential,
        a publicly-available blockchain specifically for opioid supply chains was not found. The collective review and analysis of
        blockchain, pharmaceutical supply chains, the opioid crisis, and the demonstrated blockchain model suggest that the adoption
        of blockchain systems for prescription opioid supply chains would enable numerous capabilities that could mitigate certain 
        aspects of the opioid crisis.
